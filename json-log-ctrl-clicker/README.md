# json-log-ctrl-clicker README

I really like json structrured logging, but you can't ctrl+click on file+lines on .json files in vscode like you can with .log files. This extension adds a command to vscode that will open the file and line number of the json log.

## Features

ctrl+click on file+lines on .json files in vscode like you can with .log files.
